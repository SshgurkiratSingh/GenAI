It was developed in the early 1830s and 1840s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail for use in telecommunication. Here are some key points about Morse code:\\n\\n1. **Encoding**: Each letter of the alphabet and each numeral is represented by a unique combination of dots and dashes. For example:\\n   - A: `.-`\\n   - B: `-...`\\n   - C: `-.-.`\\n   - 1: `.----`\\n   - 2: `..---`\\n\\n2. **Transmission**: Morse code can be transmitted in various ways, including sound (beeps), light (flashes), or visual signals (like flags). It is particularly useful in situations where voice communication is not possible.\\n\\n3. **International Standard**: The International Morse Code is the standardized version used worldwide, although there are variations for different languages.\\n\\n4. **Applications**: Morse code has been used in maritime communication, aviation, and amateur radio. It is also a valuable tool for emergency signaling, as it can be sent in a simple form using light or sound.\\n\\n5. **Learning**: Many enthusiasts learn Morse code for fun or as a hobby, and it is often taught in amateur radio courses.\\n\\nOverall, Morse code remains a fascinating and practical means of communication, especially in specific contexts where modern technology may fail.\",\"sender\":\"ai\"},{\"text\":\"what was encoding used by user in morse code project\",\"sender\":\"user\"},{\"text\":\"In the Morse code project described, the encoding used is as follows:\\n\\n1. **Dots and Dashes**: Each letter is represented by a combination of dots (.) and dashes (-).\\n   - A dot (.) is represented as `01`\\n   - A dash (-) is represented as `11`\\n\\n2. **Lookup Table (LUT)**: The project uses a lookup table to map ASCII characters to their corresponding Morse code values. For example, the letter 'A' is encoded in Morse code as `.-`, which translates to the binary sequence `0111`.\\n\\n3. **Algorithm**: The algorithm involves subtracting `41H` from the ASCII value to find the equivalent Morse code value, which is then stored in the LUT at the index corresponding to the letter.\\n\\nThis encoding allows the program to convert ASCII characters to Morse code effectively.\",\"sender\":\"ai\"}],\"fileName\":\"IDM.pdf\",\"title\":\"Understanding the Introduction Stage of Product Development\",\"contextWindow\":5,\"llmModel\":\"GPT-4o-mini\"}"
